Thank you for visiting my website!

I am an Assistant Professor at [Johns Hopkins Biostatistics](https://www.jhsph.edu/departments/biostatistics/), where I co-lead the Bayesian Learning and Spatio-Temporal modeling group ([BLAST Group](https://jhublast.github.io/)) as well as the Individualized Health (inHealth) and Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Lab ([inHealth/OHDSI Lab](https://github.com/nishimura-zeger-lab)).

My work centers around developing statistical and computational machinery to extract insights from large, complex data for real-world impacts. I am particularly interested in use of observational health data to improve clinical decision-making. I collaborate with clinicians from Johns Hopkins [inHealth](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/inhealth/) Precision Medicine Initiative towards the goal of delivering a right intervention for a right person at a right time. And my involvement in the broader [OHDSI](https://www.ohdsi.org/) community provides opportunities to bring together data from multiple institutions to investigate clinical questions beyond the scope of any single data source. Besides observational health analytics, I also work on several statistical (phylo-)genetics applications. My expertise includes Bayesian methods, large-scale statistical computing, as well as statistical software development.

In my free time, I enjoy Argentinian tango, traveling, culinary explorations, photography, among many other things.
