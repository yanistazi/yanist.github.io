Thank you for visiting my website!

I am currently a PhD Candidate in the [Tri-Institutional CBM PhD Program between Cornell,Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Rockefeller](https://compbio.triiprograms.org/) specializing in AI,Computational Medicine and Neuroscience and I am an MBA Candidate at[NYU Stern](https://www.stern.nyu.edu/programs-admissions/executive-mba-nyc/program-details/class-profile).
I have research and work experiences building and applying AI model in various areas with a strong focus on computational psychology, neuroscience and facial motor control (building AI models that mimic brain behavior), cancer research (prediction of disease evolution, survival analysis, genomics and computer vision with cancer imaging), drug discovery (building graph neural networks to predict protein interactions), Delta-One Trading (stock and auctions predictions) and neuro-marketing.

I obtained a Bachelor’s + MSc from MINES ParisTech in Mathematics and CS with a master exchange in Mathematical Finance at the National University of Singapore . Prior to this, I obtained a Bachelor’s degree in math and CS at the Dauphine University in Paris with a six-month focus on pure mathematics at the University of Quebec in Montreal. Before joining the PhD and MBA Programs, I worked in different industries including: Trading in New York City,  Computational Biologist at MSKCC in NYC, as a Data Scientist in London, as a Research fellow at Columbia University, etc.

My work centers around building robust AI systems by combining interdisciplinary fields to include computer science, mathematics, biology, neuroscience,  and psychology. I collaborate with clinicians, oncologists and neurologists to deliver precision medicine and make sure to help them provide the right diagnostic, treatment and intervention to the right patient. Basides this, I am involved in many projects to make sure that scientists open source their work, data and improve collaborations to help other researchers leverage their work and further contribute to healthcare digitization and thus, healthcare overall.

During my free time, I enjoy traveling, working out, watching soccer and exploring what the city has to offer.
